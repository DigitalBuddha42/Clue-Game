For the door directions tests, we chose 15,10 because the Banquet Hall door in
that cell opens up, we chose 7,3 because the game room door in that cell opens right,
we chose 5, 9 because the Office door in that cell opens down, and we chose 11,16
because the Dining Room door in that cell opens left. The other two cells were chosen
because they represent the two types of cells that aren't doorways.

For the initials tests, we chose the first and last cells, a walkway cell, and 6
other cells because those combined represented the full variety of cells
on the board.

The rest of the tests don't rely as much on our specific config files, but we do have
different constants for the numbers of columns, rows and doors.
